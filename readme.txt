Everything you need to do is to go to `Settings->Transliteration` and setup plugin according to your needs. Just follow descriptions and you will easily manage it.

= Shortcodes =
This plugin has two shortcodes that work independently of the plugin settings. These two shortcodes aim to transliterate some content. This is great if you have an article and want to display part of the text in Cyrillic, and if your entire portal is displayed in Latin.

**Cyrillic to Latin:**
`[rstr_cyr_to_lat]Ћирилица у латиницу[/rstr_cyr_to_lat]`

**Latin to Cyrillic:**
`[rstr_lat_to_cyr]Latinica u ćirilicu[/rstr_lat_to_cyr]`

== Installation ==

1. Go to `WP-Admin->Plugins->Add new`, search term "Serbian Transliteration" and click on the "install" button
2. OR, upload **serbian-transliteration.zip** to `/wp-content/plugins` directory via WordPress admin panel or upload unzipped folder to your plugins folder via FTP
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
4. Go to `Settings->Transliteration` to update options
