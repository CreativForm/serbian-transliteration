**YOU NEED TO KNOW** that even if there is compatibility for most plugins, the combination of multiple plugins still has a slight chance of some conflict. There are over a couple thousand plugins and a couple of few million individual WordPress installations. We cannot 100% guarantee that everything will work properly in all possible cases. Sometimes it happens that other plugins are not compatible with this plugin, so it is important that you contact us or other plugin authors in case of any problem so that you can solve the problem. The most common fix for most issues is if you keep all the plugins and WordPress installation up to date.

# Documentation

Everything you need to do is to go to `Settings->Transliteration` and setup plugin according to your needs. Just follow descriptions and you will easily manage it.

## Shortcodes
This plugin has two shortcodes that work independently of the plugin settings. These two shortcodes aim to transliterate some content. This is great if you have an article and want to display part of the text in Cyrillic, and if your entire portal is displayed in Latin.

**Cyrillic to Latin:**
`[rstr_cyr_to_lat]Ћирилица у латиницу[/rstr_cyr_to_lat]`

**Latin to Cyrillic:**
`[rstr_lat_to_cyr]Latinica u ćirilicu[/rstr_lat_to_cyr]`
